### New development on 2017-08-14

Added in two-column layout support. Click 'Select Form Layout' to choose 2-column form layout.

TODO/Limitations:
  * Now only support two columns layout
  * The two widgets in the same row have to be of the same height (otherwise you will see misalign-ment). We are actively working to fix it.
